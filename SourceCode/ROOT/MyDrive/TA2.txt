I am optimistic about the future of food because I think food will become healthier , cheaper and friendlier with the environment.
Initially, food will become healthier . I think organic food will be more nutritious because technology will develop in the future.Therefore, scientists can integrate more nutrients into food.

In addition, food will become cheaper because I think using modern technologies will significantly help the farmers with their job.

Last but not least, I think if everyone eats bio-fabricated meat, greenhouse gas will be reduced. Therefore, people don't need to need to raise animal for food producing.
